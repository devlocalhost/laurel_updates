RainZ drops support for crDroid: "[android_vendor_crDroidOTA](https://github.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_crDroidOTA/pull/667). Goodbyes are always hard, especially when it comes to something we've poured our time and passion into. Today, we say farewell to the Mi A3 within the crDroid family, as the motherboard has reached the end of its journey. It’s painful to let go, knowing how much it meant to us and the community, but sometimes even the best things have to find their rest. Yet, in this farewell, there’s also joy. Joy in remembering all the milestones, the shared moments of excitement with each new build, and the sheer love for making it the best we could. As we part ways, let’s hold onto the fact that the Mi A3 leaves behind a legacy, and its spirit lives on in everything else we build.". Both unofficial and official crDroid builds have been archived now.

If you want to downgrade to the [previous 3.7 version](https://t.me/bakkaqbuilds/11003), you can download it here: [MEGA Mirror](https://mega.nz/file/lf9yAbjD#wLchCJOiwkZlTmO0JgVehzKkbJmScHmT4VegMWp8hzM) | [Google Drive Mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lEB_svtXtV7X5Lf92owd3htoZ3uZCfe5/view?usp=sharing)

[ProjectBlaze](/roms/ProjectBlaze_14) got a new update, with some minor changes/improvements. Updated at 26-08, took some days to update the website due to internet issues.

A notice: These weeks I'm not really "okay" mentally, I've been trying to avoid telegram "for my own good". I'm "fine", but not that fine. Now, will (or how will) this affect laurel_updates? I am not sure. I hope it doesn't. If it does, I'll let someone else handle the website.

## 22-08-2024 - [IMPORTANT] New crDroid update, and a notice to devs.
Seems like i missed another update... which is now available [here](/roms/crDroid_14). crDroid 10.7. Enjoy.

And, a notice to devs. I've been trying to avoid using telegram. I'm actually barely using telegram, that means, i don't go online that often, and i only check DMs. Because of this, i missed 2 updates, ProjectBlaze, and crDroid, so, to the laurel_sprout devs:
Could you please send me an email whenever you release an update for your roms at `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`? And if possible, use this format:

```

body: Requesting an update for ROM_NAME from version VERSION_CURRENT (RELEASE_DATE_CURRENT) to version VERSION_NEW (RELEASE_DATE_NEW). Post link: TELEGRAM_POST_LINK
```
Explaining the fields:
- ROM_NAME: ROM name, without version
- VERSION_CURRENT: current available version on laurel_updates
- RELEASE_DATE_CURRENT: the release date of VERSION_CURRENT
- VERSION_NEW: new version
- RELEASE_DATE_NEW: the release date of VERSION_NEW
- TELEGRAM_POST_LINK: the link of the telegram post you made

Mail example:
```

```
