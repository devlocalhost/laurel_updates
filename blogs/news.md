## 01-03-2024 - Google fucks up PlayIntegrity, again.
Google did it again, and changed shit, which lead to people failing PlayIntegrity. Dumps from android_dump won't work anymore, which means you'll have to find a very very obscure device, and build the pif.json file by yourself. Someone said fingerprints from xiaomi.eu work...?
