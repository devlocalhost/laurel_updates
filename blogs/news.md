# News - Updates, releases, and more.

## 01-03-2024 - Google fucks up PlayIntegrity, again.
Google did it again, and changed shit, which lead to people failing PlayIntegrity. Dumps from android_dump won't work anymore, which means you'll have to find a very very obscure device, and build the pif.json file by yourself. Someone said fingerprints from xiaomi.eu work...?

For more information and updates, I recommend you join the [Play Integrity Fix - Chiteroman](https://t.me/playintegrityfix) telegram group, or check XDA posts like [this](https://xdaforums.com/t/module-play-integrity-fix-safetynet-fix.4607985/).

"You might be aware that I've ended my development for the Mi A3. To support those who maintain and build custom ROMs specifically for the Xiaomi Mi A3, I'm making my repositories available: [device_xiaomi_laurel_sprout](https://github.com/zafeey/device_xiaomi_laurel_sprout), [kernel_xiaomi_laurel_sprout](https://github.com/zafeey/kernel_xiaomi_laurel_sprout), [android_vendor_miuicamera](https://github.com/zafeey/android_vendor_miuicamera). **Please note that the vendor tree is not included.

## 03-02-2024 - LineageOS 21 Released, EvolutionX 13 Discontinued.
LineageOS has been finally released, after 3 months. The reason it took this long, was due to a major bug that heavily affected video playback. Enjoy it by clicking [here](/roms/LineageOS_14).

EvolutionX 13 has been discontinued not only from the maintainer, NOT_SURE, but also from EvolutionX, [officially](https://t.me/EvolutionXOfficial/1885): "As of today, Android 13 support has been dropped. We'll continue working on and improving our Android 14 sources. Thanks!". The EvolutionX 13 version has been removed from the website.
