# Malicious magisk modules spreading on telegram
What happened? Some one has been spreading harmful modules on telegram.

"Please don't install fake "play integrity fix" modules that will brick your device. It's currently being spread into custom ROM device groups right now. Only install known modules or ones included in your group's notes or if they're known GitHub links. Just had a user try to spread this fake module in one of our groups.". From [EvolutionX group](https://t.me/EvolutionXOfficial/1871)

I want to make clear that:
1. The modules hosted on this website ARE NOT malicious, and are safe
2. I do not link to the source of modules or apps, because they could be deleted and be hard to find the original, or an alternative
3. I am NOT responsible for any damage caused by any of the modules installed/downloaded from here.
   - My intention  is not to brick or harm devices
   - It is simply normal. Not every module is compatible with every device, custom rom, or other modules.
