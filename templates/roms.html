<h2>Android Versions</h2>
<p>
    Recommended versions are
    <strong>Android 11 and 14</strong>
    , because these are the ones usually getting updates.
</p>
<p>
    Android 10 and 9 are not included because no one is interested, plus most
    laurel users are using "android 11 firmware", which enables anti-rollback,
    preventing flashing anything lower than android 11 (will result in a "hard
    brick").
</p>

<h2>"FAQ"</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Which ROM should i use?</li>
    <p>
        It all depends on your needs. Do you want customization? Then pick
        EvolutionX, for example. Do you want something lightweight, something
        minimal? Pick LineageOS (I'm currently using LineageOS 21, by the way.)
    </p>

    <li>How do i flash XYZ ROM?</li>
    <p>
        Please check the support group for the flashing instructions. All ROMs
        have a telegram support group linked. Join, and simply ask for flashing
        instructions.
    </p>

    <li>Which ROM/kernel is the best??!!!!?!</li>
    <p>
        Stop asking for the best ROMs/Kernels (for battery, for performance or
        any other criteria), it doesn't exist. If there was one true best
        ROM/Kernel, do you think there would be other ROMs or Kernels? There's
        only subjectively best and that's different for everyone. Everyone has
        different usage patterns &amp; preferences, so when asking for the best,
        you get the best for them, not the best for you. The only way you'll
        find the best one for you is by trying them yourself. They're all free,
        anyway. BEST IS SUBJECTIVE.
    </p>
