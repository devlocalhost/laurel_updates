<h2>Android Versions</h2>
<p>
    Recommended versions are
    <strong>Android 11 and 14</strong>, because only these versions get updates.
    Most users are probably using Android 14 too.
    Android 10 and 9 are not included because no one is (probably) interested, plus most
    laurel users are (again, probably) using "android 11 firmware", which enables anti-rollback,
    preventing flashing anything lower than android 11 (will result in a "hard
    brick").
</p>

<h2 class="colored">Versions</h2>
<p>ROM's under this sections are "actively" maintained or just maintained. Recommended version is 14, unless you want more stability, performance or battery life, then go ahead with 11. (HIGHLY depends on the ROM and/or ROM maintainer!!)</p>
<div class="tabs">
    <a href="#14" class="no-fade-animation">14</a>
    <a href="#11" class="no-fade-animation">11</a>
    <a href="#10" class="no-fade-animation">10</a>
</div>

<h2 class="red" id="archive">Archived ROM's</h2>
<p>ROM's under this sections are not maintained at all, but they're still available to download. I do not recommend you to use any of the ROM's below. "Then why are you including them? Why don't you get rid of them?" Well, i think its a good idea to have an archive, so yeah...</p>

<h2>"FAQ"</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Which ROM should i use?</li>
    <p>
        It all depends on your needs. Do you want customization? Then pick
        EvolutionX, for example. Do you want something lightweight, something
        minimal? Pick LineageOS (I'm currently using LineageOS 21, by the way.)
    </p>

    <li>How do i flash XYZ ROM?</li>
    <p>
        Please check the support group for the flashing instructions. All ROMs
        have a telegram support group linked. Join, and simply ask for flashing
        instructions.
    </p>

    <li>Which ROM/kernel is the best??!!!!?!</li>
    <p>
        Stop asking for the best ROMs/Kernels (for battery, for performance or
        any other criteria), it doesn't exist. If there was one true best
        ROM/Kernel, do you think there would be other ROMs or Kernels? There's
        only subjectively best and that's different for everyone. Everyone has
        different usage patterns &amp; preferences, so when asking for the best,
        you get the best for them, not the best for you. The only way you'll
        find the best one for you is by trying them yourself. They're all free,
        anyway. BEST IS SUBJECTIVE.
    </p>
</ul>
