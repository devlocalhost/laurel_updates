## 08-05-2025 - New releases for TheSillyOk Kernels.
TheSillyOk has updated his kernels, with some new KernelSU things... or whatever they're called. I'm not really into this kind of stuff, so just check the [changelog](/kernels/thesillyok_kf#changelog) and [notes](/kernels/thesillyok_kf#notes).

## 06-05-2025 - QPR2 Update for PixelMagic.

## 04-05-2025 - PixelOS gets updated.

## 23-04-2025 - Bug fix release for AxionOS.
PowerX-NOT releases a bug fix update for AxionOS, which fixes a bug with hotspot feature. Download the new update by clicking [here](/roms/AxionOS_15#downloads).

## 16-04-2025 - New PixelOS update, website status gets better.
bakka releases a new update for PixelOS, bringing a very interesting feature: flashlight brightness control, and April Security Patch. For more details, click [here](/roms/PixelOS_15).

More news: I finally managed to find a solution for the downtimes and other fuckeries! Finally! And im doing all this at work, lol. I fixed the scripts and services, but i havent applied them yet to this website (did you know i have more websites? Check my main website [here](https://dev64.xyz)). I will apply the fixes soon.

## 15-04-2025 - [IMPORTANT] Degraded website status, New AxionOS update.
DEGRADED WEBSITE STATUS. Expect a lot of (or few, minor) downtimes. I made a oopsie woopsie fuckery and everything is shitting itself, from nginx, to service management and other bullshit, and as you can see, i have been trying to fix this issue for hours but i am having skill issues. That is why i said "expect a lot of downtimes".


But hey, good news! PowerX-NOT brings version 1.3 BETA here! For more details, check the changelog by clicking [here](/roms/AxionOS_15#changelog).

## 07-04-2025 - TheSillyOk updates his kernel forks.
He also adds Snowflake to his list, which was released yesterday, with kernelSU support! Check it out [here.](/kernels/thesillyok_kf).

NOTE: His "kernel" before was called NoName Fork. I decided to rename it to TheSillyOk kernel forks instead, since in the downloads, there are many kernels listed which are not his own. They are just forks, with minor improvements.

## 06-04-2025 - New kernel: Snowflake, crDroid maintainer drops support, old maintainer might come back.
There's a new kernel available for laurel: [Snowflake](/kernels/snowflake), maintained by RainZ, previous maintainer of crDroid, who might make a comeback, as the "current" maintainer decided to drop support:

"I got many things to learn as is. Actively compiling is becoming hard and harder with life. I want to learn some actual programming and get a job and by then I'll probably redo it"

## 02-04-2025 - [UPDATE] Migrated from vercel to hetzner.
I am migrating the website from vercel to a hetzner server I bought. Downtime is expected, but it shouldn't be that long. I'll keep y'all updated.

Update: Migration was successful! Expert a more detailed update and more details soon.

Update 2: As i said above, the website now runs on my hetzner server, instead of vercel. What does this mean? The website should be faster. Faster loading times, less waiting. Basically small minor improvements for you, users/visitors, but a major/big thing for me, because this allows me to add features which will be useful for me, and maybe you. Features like uptime, last modified date for blogs, and more.

Also, not sure if you have noticed, but the domain of the website has changed again! It is now under [dev64.xyz](https://dev64.xyz/). The domain was cheap, but that does not mean you can use [https://laurel-updates.dev64.xyz](https://laurel-updates.dev64.xyz) instead of [https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu](https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu). Please continue using that URL. It makes sure you are always redirected to the working, up-to-date URL for laurel_updates.

## 17-03-2025 - New LineageOS 18.1 update.
That's right. LineageOS 18.1, the only Android 11 ROM, is still alive. What's new? Check out by clicking [here](/roms/LineageOS_11#changelog).

## 14-03-2025 - Official EvolutionX for laurel, New update for NoName Fork, and archived some ROMs.
Yes. Official EvolutionX for laurel_sprout, thats right. By Onelots, a new (?) member of the community. Check it out [here](/roms/EvolutionX_15)! PowerX-NOT version of EvolutionX has been archived, and the link has changed! It's [EvolutionX_U_15](/roms/EvolutionX_U_15) now.

[Statistics](/stats) are (kind of) back! I basically improved them, because before they were kind of broken, innacurate, and were not unique. They could be easily manipulated.

How am i gathering these statistics? I am using [vercel analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics), which is a privacy friendly feature. Statistics are manually updated by me, for now, monthly. So, see you next month, i guess...

Btw, did you know that the letter "s" ("Your go-to hub for laurel_`s`prout ROMs", the highlighted "s") in the [main](/) page redirects to the statistics page? No? Well, now you do.

## 29-01-2025 - Major laurel_updates update.
Hello to everyone. The website got a major UI change, which I really like, and I'd like to hear your feedback too! You can let me know, by filling this [Google form](https://forms.gle/GZzYKWXFhFo36ktc6). But before voting, please use the website for a few mins, get familiar with the new UI, and then vote. Thank you.

Now let's say what's new/different (which is kind of obvious, but there are some under the hood changes):
 - UI has been rewritten. The website has better colors now (in my opinion), elements (like lists, and text too) look better.
 - Replaced "Go back" button with "Share". I don't really think anyone was using the "Go back" button anyway, and to be honest, I'm not sure if users will use this new button too, which is actually very important they use this button, instead of copying the link from the address bar of their browsers. When the user uses this button instead, the link that will be copied will look something like this: "https://devlocalhost.github.io/XXYYZZ". Anything after that last slash in the URL, redirects to the working link of laurel_updates.
 - Kind of debloated/fixed the CSS, most of the JavaScript code removed. I'm not sure if people know, but I am JavaScript-phobic. I hate it. So I decided to remove it. While some functionality was removed, like copying text from code tags, scroll to top, and progress bar, this does not impact user UX that much (I hope).
 - Added privacy friendly analytics. Please don't "boo" yet. The analytics are privacy friendly. Only the following things are collected: which pages (roms, kernels, blogs) you access, your device type (desktop, mobile), OS, and country. Nothing else is logged or collected. Why am I collecting all this you might ask? For statistics! Everything month, starting from February, I will post analytics about laurel_updates, like most viewed ROMs, kernels, etc.

I hope you all enjoy this rewrite, and if not, I'd be glad to hear your feedback, which you can give by going to the google form I linked above. Thank you for using laurel_updates.

For [Pixelage](/roms/ProjectPixelage_15)... "Since I've decided to discontinue Pixelage, I’ve built PixelOS. I’m about to release a build where everything works perfectly, including FOD (Fingerprint on Display). For anyone thinking about flashing Pixelage (now EOL), it might be worth waiting a few hours and switching to PixelOS instead. It offers a similar experience but with full functionality.
i'm sorry. :c" - bakka

The PixelOS build bakka promised is now here. Enjoy it by clicking [here](/roms/PixelOS_15).

## 26-11-2024 - [IMPORTANT, MUST READ] MAJOR ISSUES WITH HOSTING. Reviews feature temporarily removed.

**PLEASE READ TILL THE END!! IT IS VERY VERY URGENT AND IMPORTANT!!**

### Suspension, downtime. Why?
laurel_updates was suspended by the hosting provider (Render) "due to a high volume of server-initiated traffic, such as accessing an external database". The reason for the suspension was because of the reviews feature I added a few weeks ago.

### Okay, what now? Whats next?
This feature is now fully reverted. Users cannot post or see previews anymore. I don't know if I'm going to add this feature back. This is the second major downgrade, and I'm sure the website will lose once again traffic/users. Remember the downtime last year? That downtime caused a big drop on visits/traffic. I do not want to cause another major/big downtime.
There are 2 options now: 1: Purchase a paid server/VPS and a domain (more reliable), and 2: find other free hosts (unreliable).
For now, I will use vercel as the main provider, and koyeb as the secondary/alternative one when main provider is down.

### An update to the URL/link
You may have seen this URL/link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu](https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu). This is the link I send to any user that asks for laurel_updates. That link will ALWAYS redirect to the CURRENT WORKING version of laurel_updates. I encourage EVERYONE to use THAT LINK INSTEAD of the link you get redirected to (for example, [https://laurel-updates.onrender.com/](https://laurel-updates.onrender.com/) or [https://laurel-updates-dev64.koyeb.app/](https://laurel-updates-dev64.koyeb.app/)). Here is another cool feature: adding anything after "https://devlocalhost.github.io/" will redirect you to laurel_updates. For example, this link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms](https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms) will redirect you to the ROMs page. This link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms/LineageOS_22](https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms/LineageOS_22) will redirect you to a ROM (LineageOS 22).

### Telegram channel
I created a [telegram channel](https://t.me/laurel_updates) where I post updates about the website. It's basically this page, but the headlines. I ALSO recommend you join this channel, so you are up to date if there is any issue going on with the website.

### One more thing
If you face any issues with laurel_updates (slow loading times, errors, unable to access, and more) PLEASE let me know by contacting me via telegram: `@dev6400` (username), or by email: `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`

RainZ drops support for crDroid: "[android_vendor_crDroidOTA](https://github.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_crDroidOTA/pull/667). Goodbyes are always hard, especially when it comes to something we've poured our time and passion into. Today, we say farewell to the Mi A3 within the crDroid family, as the motherboard has reached the end of its journey. It’s painful to let go, knowing how much it meant to us and the community, but sometimes even the best things have to find their rest. Yet, in this farewell, there’s also joy. Joy in remembering all the milestones, the shared moments of excitement with each new build, and the sheer love for making it the best we could. As we part ways, let’s hold onto the fact that the Mi A3 leaves behind a legacy, and its spirit lives on in everything else we build.". Both unofficial and official crDroid builds have been archived now.

[ProjectBlaze](/roms/ProjectBlaze_14) got a new update, with some minor changes/improvements. Updated at 26-08, took some days to update the website due to internet issues.

A notice: These weeks I'm not really "okay" mentally, I've been trying to avoid telegram "for my own good". I'm "fine", but not that fine. Now, will (or how will) this affect laurel_updates? I am not sure. I hope it doesn't. If it does, I'll let someone else handle the website.

## 22-08-2024 - [IMPORTANT] New crDroid update, and a notice to devs.
Seems like i missed another update... which is now available [here](/roms/crDroid_14). crDroid 10.7. Enjoy.

And, a notice to devs. I've been trying to avoid using telegram. I'm actually barely using telegram, that means, i don't go online that often, and i only check DMs. Because of this, i missed 2 updates, ProjectBlaze, and crDroid, so, to the laurel_sprout devs:
Could you please send me an email whenever you release an update for your roms at `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`? And if possible, use this format:

- VERSION_CURRENT: current available version on laurel_updates
- RELEASE_DATE_CURRENT: the release date of VERSION_CURRENT
- VERSION_NEW: new version
- RELEASE_DATE_NEW: the release date of VERSION_NEW

Google did it again, and changed shit, which lead to people failing PlayIntegrity. Dumps from android_dump won't work anymore, which means you'll have to find a very very obscure device, and build the pif.json file by yourself. Someone said fingerprints from xiaomi.eu work...?
