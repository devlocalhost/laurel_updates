# Stock ROM links
These files have been re-uploaded, since the website where you usually get stock ROM has been slow lately. The links will be up as long as someone clicks on it every 60 (or 90?) days. Note: these files are fastboot type, not recovery. When you unzip, you will see some scripts. If you need assistance, ask in [Mi A3 | OFFICIAL telegram group](https://t.me/A3Official). If you're looking for the guide to flash stock ROM, click [here](/blog/flash-stock-rom).

## EEA (EU) version

### How do I know which version I have?
The easiest way to tell is by looking at the back of your phone: ![image showing the bacl of the device](/static/img/dev-ice.jpg)

The "Model" part is what we need. If the last two letters are "SH" (like in the picture above), means you have the EEA unit. If you see "SI", you have the global unit. If you do not see any of these logos (especially the "CE"and the trash bin logo), you have the global version.
