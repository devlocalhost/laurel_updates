## 29-01-2025 - Major laurel_updates update.
Hello to everyone. The website got a major UI change, which I really like, and I'd like to hear your feedback too! You can let me know, by filling this [Google form](https://forms.gle/GZzYKWXFhFo36ktc6). But before voting, please use the website for a few mins, get familiar with the new UI, and then vote. Thank you.

Now let's say what's new/different (which is kind of obvious, but there are some under the hood changes):
 - UI has been rewritten. The website has better colors now (in my opinion), elements (like lists, and text too) look better.
 - Replaced "Go back" button with "Share". I don't really think anyone was using the "Go back" button anyway, and to be honest, I'm not sure if users will use this new button too, which is actually very important they use this button, instead of copying the link from the address bar of their browsers. When the user uses this button instead, the link that will be copied will look something like this: "https://devlocalhost.github.io/XXYYZZ". Anything after that last slash in the URL, redirects to the working link of laurel_updates.
 - Kind of debloated/fixed the CSS, most of the JavaScript code removed. I'm not sure if people know, but I am JavaScript-phobic. I hate it. So I decided to remove it. While some functionality was removed, like copying text from code tags, scroll to top, and progress bar, this does not impact user UX that much (I hope).
 - Added privacy friendly analytics. Please don't "boo" yet. The analytics are privacy friendly. Only the following things are collected: which pages (roms, kernels, blogs) you access, your device type (desktop, mobile), OS, and country. Nothing else is logged or collected. Why am I collecting all this you might ask? For statistics! Everything month, starting from February, I will post analytics about laurel_updates, like most viewed ROMs, kernels, etc.

I hope you all enjoy this rewrite, and if not, I'd be glad to hear your feedback, which you can give by going to the google form I linked above. Thank you for using laurel_updates.

## 27-01-2025 - PowerX-NOT brings EvolutionX back.
PowerX-NOT has released EvolutionX, version 10.2, which is Android 15. Check it out [here.](/roms/EvolutionX_15)

## 21-01-2025 - New crDroid and Pixelage update, bakka brings PixelOS.
This new crDroid update brings/fixes (?) Circle to Search. More things included too. Check the changelog [here](/roms/crDroid_15#changelog).

For [Pixelage](/roms/ProjectPixelage_15)... "Since I've decided to discontinue Pixelage, I’ve built PixelOS. I’m about to release a build where everything works perfectly, including FOD (Fingerprint on Display). For anyone thinking about flashing Pixelage (now EOL), it might be worth waiting a few hours and switching to PixelOS instead. It offers a similar experience but with full functionality.
i'm sorry. :c" - bakka

The PixelOS build bakka promised is now here. Enjoy it by clicking [here](/roms/PixelOS_15).

## 20-12-2024 - crDroid gets revived by leoxvis.

## 26-11-2024 - [IMPORTANT, MUST READ] MAJOR ISSUES WITH HOSTING. Reviews feature temporarily removed.

**PLEASE READ TILL THE END!! IT IS VERY VERY URGENT AND IMPORTANT!!**

### Suspension, downtime. Why?
laurel_updates was suspended by the hosting provider (Render) "due to a high volume of server-initiated traffic, such as accessing an external database". The reason for the suspension was because of the reviews feature I added a few weeks ago.

### Okay, what now? Whats next?
This feature is now fully reverted. Users cannot post or see previews anymore. I don't know if I'm going to add this feature back. This is the second major downgrade, and I'm sure the website will lose once again traffic/users. Remember the downtime last year? That downtime caused a big drop on visits/traffic. I do not want to cause another major/big downtime.
There are 2 options now: 1: Purchase a paid server/VPS and a domain (more reliable), and 2: find other free hosts (unreliable).
For now, I will use vercel as the main provider, and koyeb as the secondary/alternative one when main provider is down.

### An update to the URL/link
You may have seen this URL/link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu](https://devlocalhost.github.io/lu). This is the link I send to any user that asks for laurel_updates. That link will ALWAYS redirect to the CURRENT WORKING version of laurel_updates. I encourage EVERYONE to use THAT LINK INSTEAD of the link you get redirected to (for example, [https://laurel-updates.onrender.com/](https://laurel-updates.onrender.com/) or [https://laurel-updates-dev64.koyeb.app/](https://laurel-updates-dev64.koyeb.app/)). Here is another cool feature: adding anything after "https://devlocalhost.github.io/" will redirect you to laurel_updates. For example, this link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms](https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms) will redirect you to the ROMs page. This link: [https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms/LineageOS_22](https://devlocalhost.github.io/roms/LineageOS_22) will redirect you to a ROM (LineageOS 22).

### Telegram channel
I created a [telegram channel](https://t.me/laurel_updates) where I post updates about the website. It's basically this page, but the headlines. I ALSO recommend you join this channel, so you are up to date if there is any issue going on with the website.

### One more thing
If you face any issues with laurel_updates (slow loading times, errors, unable to access, and more) PLEASE let me know by contacting me via telegram: `@dev6400` (username), or by email: `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`

RainZ drops support for crDroid: "[android_vendor_crDroidOTA](https://github.com/crdroidandroid/android_vendor_crDroidOTA/pull/667). Goodbyes are always hard, especially when it comes to something we've poured our time and passion into. Today, we say farewell to the Mi A3 within the crDroid family, as the motherboard has reached the end of its journey. It’s painful to let go, knowing how much it meant to us and the community, but sometimes even the best things have to find their rest. Yet, in this farewell, there’s also joy. Joy in remembering all the milestones, the shared moments of excitement with each new build, and the sheer love for making it the best we could. As we part ways, let’s hold onto the fact that the Mi A3 leaves behind a legacy, and its spirit lives on in everything else we build.". Both unofficial and official crDroid builds have been archived now.

Yes, you read it right. Android 10. But, with android 11 firmware. Means, you can flash it, even if you upgraded your phone to android 11. Unfortunately, I do not know details about this ROM, or how this works (android 10, but android 11 firmware), so go ahead and ask on the support group for the ROM. You can find the support group by clicking [here](/roms/crDroid_10#notes). Or, click [here](/roms/crDroid_10) to view the ROM page.

## 30-08-2024 - Important notice about new Project Blaze update.
From the maintainer of Project Blaze for laurel_sprout:
"some problem with source i'm not really aware of, in the latest blaze update, causes systemui to infinitely crash and it's fixable only by formatting data. please take backups if you want to still use it, but i strongly suggest you to downgrade or use another rom until fixed."

If you want to downgrade to the [previous 3.7 version](https://t.me/bakkaqbuilds/11003), you can download it here: [MEGA Mirror](https://mega.nz/file/lf9yAbjD#wLchCJOiwkZlTmO0JgVehzKkbJmScHmT4VegMWp8hzM) | [Google Drive Mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lEB_svtXtV7X5Lf92owd3htoZ3uZCfe5/view?usp=sharing)

## 29-08-2024 - [IMPORTANT] New ProjectBlaze update, and another notice.
[ProjectBlaze](/roms/ProjectBlaze_14) got a new update, with some minor changes/improvements. Updated at 26-08, took some days to update the website due to internet issues.

A notice: These weeks I'm not really "okay" mentally, I've been trying to avoid telegram "for my own good". I'm "fine", but not that fine. Now, will (or how will) this affect laurel_updates? I am not sure. I hope it doesn't. If it does, I'll let someone else handle the website.

## 22-08-2024 - [IMPORTANT] New crDroid update, and a notice to devs.
Seems like i missed another update... which is now available [here](/roms/crDroid_14). crDroid 10.7. Enjoy.

And, a notice to devs. I've been trying to avoid using telegram. I'm actually barely using telegram, that means, i don't go online that often, and i only check DMs. Because of this, i missed 2 updates, ProjectBlaze, and crDroid, so, to the laurel_sprout devs:
Could you please send me an email whenever you release an update for your roms at `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`? And if possible, use this format:

- RELEASE_DATE_CURRENT: the release date of VERSION_CURRENT

Google did it again, and changed shit, which lead to people failing PlayIntegrity. Dumps from android_dump won't work anymore, which means you'll have to find a very very obscure device, and build the pif.json file by yourself. Someone said fingerprints from xiaomi.eu work...?
