## What is ViPER4AndroidRepackaged

[ViPER4AndroidRepackaged](https://github.com/programminghoch10/ViPER4AndroidRepackaged) is a powerful EQ app which requires root ([magisk](/help/installing-magisk)), with many options and modifications you can use/do.

## How to install ViPER4AndroidRepackaged

1. Make sure you have [magisk](/help/installing-magisk) installed.
2. Download the latest [ViPER4AndroidRepackaged zip](https://github.com/programminghoch10/ViPER4AndroidRepackaged/releases) from github releases, and install it from magisk. Reboot your phone once its done.
3. Check your app drawer, a new app should appear after a few seconds. Thats it.

# Using the app
Open any media player, play a track, change any settings in V4A app and see if it works, or just simply click the second icon at the top (looks like a chip), next to the app's title and see what's the status. If it says `Processing: No`, try turning off or on "Legacy mode" in settings. Again, make sure you're playing something before checking status. And, maybe try other apps.

## Still not working?
Installing [Audio Modification Library](https://laurelupdates.dev64.workers.dev/AudioModificationLibrary.zip) magisk module should fix that.

## STILL not working!?!?
