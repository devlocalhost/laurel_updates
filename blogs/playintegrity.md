# PlayIntegrity (#1)
SafetyNet will get [discontinued](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/safetynet/deprecation-timeline#safetynet_attestation_deprecation_timeline) in 2025, and PlayIntegrity is the replacement. But on custom ROMs, it can fail, because *elgoog moment*

## Available guides
Note: guide #1 and #2 DO NOT WORK ANYMORE. 3 still works, but it is not easy to follow (for noobs). For more information, check [The news - 01/03/2024](/blog/news).

1. [#1 - by tm](https://rentry.org/pifguide_laurel): Easy to understand, with images. A few clicks, needs a PC
2. [#2](/help/pif-auto): Detailed, no PC required
3. [#3](/help/pif-diy): Detailed, but for "pros" only, no PC required

# Help needed!!
If there's anyone interested in testing If any of the linked guides work, please do and send me a message on [telegram](https://t.me/dev6400), or email: `contact64.qualify966@passinbox.com`.

I can't bother anymore with this. I can't test, and I don't really care about this. I'm using LineageOS with MicroG, which means no PlayIntegrity for me, plus, I don't even care about Play Integrity.
