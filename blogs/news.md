## 03-02-2024 - LineageOS 21 Released, EvolutionX 13 Discontinued.
LineageOS has been finally released, after 3 months. The reason it took this long, was due to a major bug that heavily affected video playback. Enjoy it by clicking [here](/roms/LineageOS_14).
EvolutionX 13 has been discontinued not only from the maintainer, NOT_SURE, but also from EvolutionX, [officially](https://t.me/EvolutionXOfficial/1885): "As of today, Android 13 support has been dropped. We'll continue working on and improving our Android 14 sources. Thanks!". The EvolutionX 13 version has been removed from the website.
