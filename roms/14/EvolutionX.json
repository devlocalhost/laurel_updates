For example the CPU has to wait until a certain file is read. Therefore it makes sense to apply some kind of compression which results in a tiny bit more CPU consumption, but overall a lot faster experience for the user and faster application launch times + better performance. F2FS compression achieves all that by compressing certain files (at the moment apks, some system files and libraries are compressed) on a filesystem level. Existing user data cannot be compressed easily therefore clean flashing with a compatible recovery is necessary for this feature to work. Latest Evolution-x Recovery is recommended if you want to enable F2FS compression. You must format data in Evolution-x recovery for F2FS compression to work</p><h3>How can I check if F2FS compression is working?</h3><p><code>mount | grep compress</code> in termux. No root is required. If it is working, you should see something like <a href='https://t.me/screenshot_mia3/481'>this</a></p>",
