# What is EROFS

Enhanced Read-Only FileSystem (EROFS) is a FS made by Huawei which has been mainlined for sometime now. It's essentially a FS focusing on better random read performance while compressing partition sizes to its max. It improves boot time, faster app launches and you can even bench it with CPDT to see the scores being arguably better.
