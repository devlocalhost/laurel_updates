<p>Unfortunately, you won't find much here. No. 912 is EOL/Discontinued, and the other two are included in almost every ROM these days (except NoName Fork). </p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Kernels with version equal to, and older than 4.14.336 (in this case, both No.912 and NoName), will NOT WORK in recent ROMs that are QPR2 or higher (have security patch of March and up). They will work in older ones only, like QPR1 (or, February patch and below). This is due to Android code changes (?)</p>

    {% for kernel in data["kernels"] %}
    <li>
        <a href="kernels/{{ kernel['route_name'] }}">{{ kernel["name"] }}</a>
    </li>
